# TODO

## Outstanding
- Revert `REPO_RAW_URL` in corelink.py from feature branch URL back to `main` before merging PR
- Merge PR `claude/add-usage-examples-fh9kU` into `main`
- Populate "Reserved" tab with future functionality
- Add more GPU metrics (temperature, utilization, memory) to cluster table
- Add sorting/filtering to GPU table
- Consider adding node uptime or last-seen column
- Consider per-node monitor metrics (show each node's resource usage in the cluster table)
